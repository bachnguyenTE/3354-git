(a) Two commits. 
(b) When the GitHub repos was originally created by the instructor (When a GitHub repos is first created). 
(c) The git log command displays committed snapshots, only operates on the commit history. Git status command
on the other hand lets you inspect the working directory and the staging area, which may not have been committed. 
(d) Unstaged files are files that exist in the Git repository, but they contain changes that Git hasn't recorded
into its version history. Untracked files are files that exist locally, but aren't a part of the Git repository/
An untracked file's change history will not be recorded and it will not be pushed when using git push. 
(e) Git reset has various uses, including modifying the index, change the commit that a branch head is currently
pointing at, and alter existing history. Git checkout on the other hand allows user to navigate between the branches,
updating the files in the working directory to match the version on the branch, and tells Git to record all new commits.
(f) There are various scenarios to this. If the local changes have no overlap with remote changes (new files, or
modification of unchanged remote files), then git pull will pull the remote changes without affecting your local changes. 
If there are overlaps, they will either have to be manually resolved, or overridden by the remote changes. 
Use git stash to work around this situation.
